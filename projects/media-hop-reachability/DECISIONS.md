## H001 — Separate project; implementation in Amp mesh

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-09-04 — Amp underlay)  
**Decision:** This project owns the **program and consume contract**. **Implementation of reachability** lives in **Amp + `src/domain/mesh/`** (ch0 addr ads, addr book, DialBack, UPnP, circuit, **Amp Coordinated Punch**). Calls/mesh **consume** dialability; they do not reimplement NAT traversal. In-tree libp2p retains PeerId/crypto helpers only (A017) — not a product Host/DCUtR path.  
**Rationale:** One peer stack (N022/V026/D10); app ICE-alikes diverge and rot.  
**Alternatives:** Forever SoftMigrate-only multiaddr glue (rejected — H007); revive libp2p DCUtR as product punch (rejected — A017).

---

## H002 — Publish in-stack > punch > circuit > fail

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-09-04 — insert ACP before circuit)  
**Decision:** Prefer **stack address book + Reachable ads**, then **Amp Coordinated Punch** ([H009](#h009--amp-coordinated-punch-acp)), then **circuit**, then SoftMigrate failure. No product dependency on mid-call addr gather.  
**Rationale:** Direct PeerLinks are cheaper/lower-latency than TURN-analogue circuit when NATs are punchable; circuit remains the PeerId-path fallback.  
**Alternatives:** App `call_hop_addrs` primary (rejected); punch after multi-hop only (rejected — parallel tracks).

---

## H003 — Contacts may mirror stack addrs (cache only)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Decision:** Contact `multiaddrs` remain a **TTL UX/cache** optionally filled from the stack — not the source of truth for dial. PeerId is identity.  
**Rationale:** SoftMigrate already reads contacts; truth should move to host address book.  
**Alternatives:** Contacts-only forever.

---

## H004 — No WebRTC / no app STUN for hops

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-09-04 — Amp observed addrs)  
**Decision:** No WebRTC ICE/STUN for hop dial. Observed addrs via **DialBack / ch0 ads / UPnP** (and later punch success) inside Amp mesh.  
**Rationale:** V026; one stack.  
**Alternatives:** libjuice STUN for advertise only (rejected as product path).

---

## H005 — Circuit last resort; bill media hop

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-08-01 — brokered path via N024)  
**Decision:** Circuit may enable dial to hop PeerId. Prefer contact then seed bridges (N014). Evolve custom circuit toward PeerId-friendly semantics (L3). Successful **Amp Coordinated Punch** prefers **direct attach** over brokered.

**Billing — two attach modes:**

| Mode | When | Payer / quote |
|------|------|----------------|
| **Direct attach** | A dials **`media_relay` hop B** directly (stack dialable; no broker) | **A pays B** — N019 quote/ceiling on B ([V022](../p2p-av-calls/DECISIONS.md)) |
| **Brokered attach** | A uses **immediate relay R1** for path and/or media (multi-hop, partition, or R1-as-service) | **A pays R1 only** — bundled circuit + subcontracted media + SLA ([N024](../p2p-mesh/DECISIONS.md#n024--immediate-relay-as-service-broker)) |

Direct attach remains the simple volunteer / friend-SFU path. Brokered attach is the unified commercial face when R1 orchestrates reachability and downstream `media_relay` capacity.

**Rationale:** Clients need a path without target public IP; friend hops should stay one quote with B; brokered paths need one payer and one SLA owner.  
**Alternatives:** Fail without circuit; always bill B even through R1 (rejected for broker UX — see N024).

## H006 — Mobile default Client; call-scoped listen on Wi‑Fi

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-08-01 — **N025**)  
**Decision:** Mobile **defaults** to Client: no always-on listen, no always-on `media_relay`, no Node capability UI.

**Planned exception ([N025](../p2p-mesh/DECISIONS.md#n025--mobile-call-scoped-listen-on-wi-fi-not-full-node)):** **Ephemeral listen** on **Wi‑Fi** during a **foreground call** (and optional later **Wi‑Fi helper** toggle) so peers can dial by PeerId on LAN and in-call mobile hops can attach. Scope and relay admission remain **contacts / in-call only** — not public infrastructure.

Idle background reachability still uses **outbound dial + circuit** (and later punch when an introducer Session exists), not persistent mobile listen.

**Rationale:** Role model + battery; scoped listen fixes LAN PeerId dial without full Node.  
**Alternatives:** Mobile temporary hop with no listen gating (rejected — battery/abuse); full mobile Node (rejected).

## H007 — No app-layer hop candidate exchange as product path

**Status:** Accepted (updated 2026-09-21 — narrow R1 announce carve-out)  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Decision:** Do **not** ship or reintroduce **`call_hop_addrs`** (or similar call-signaling **multiaddr / candidate-list** gather) as the durable hop reachability design. Uncommitted prototypes were removed. Temporary dogfood hacks need an explicit ADR if ever revived. Candidate exchange for punch belongs **in-stack** via introducer Sessions ([H009](#h009--amp-coordinated-punch-acp)), not call signaling.

**Narrow carve-outs:**
- ([H011](#h011--circuit-r1-rendezvous-dialer-authoritative) L3.1c): After the dialer has already chosen an immediate relay, an optional additive **single PeerId** field (`circuit_r1`) may confirm that choice so the answerer can late-reserve. **Forbidden:** lists of candidates, observed UDP endpoints, STUN, or pre-choice hop shopping over call control.
- ([H012](#h012--punch-via-call-signaling-when-no-amp-introducer) B29): When **no Amp introducer Session** is available (circuit not-reg / seeds cannot introduce), a **narrow ACP sync** may ride call-control — same punch semantics as H009, not a second hop-dial toolkit.

**Rationale:** Duplicates what addr book / punch / circuit should do; fights “reachability inside Amp mesh.” One post-ack PeerId is rendezvous confirm, not gather. Signaling punch is only a fallback introducer channel when Amp I is missing.  
**Alternatives:** Keep thin gather until L1 (rejected — prefer document gap + stack work).

## H008 — Multi-hop circuit chains (planned)

**Status:** Accepted (plan only — **not implemented**)  
**Date:** 2026-08-01  
**Updated:** 2026-09-04 (parallel to ACP; not a substitute for punch)  
**Decision:** Custom circuit must evolve from **single-hop** to **multi-hop transitive paths** (A → immediate relay **R1** → optional upstream **R2+** → target **B**). Consumer **selects and contracts with R1 only** ([N024](../p2p-mesh/DECISIONS.md#n024--immediate-relay-as-service-broker)). R1 chooses upstream relays and (when brokered) subcontracted **`media_relay`** capacity on B.

**Hop limit:** Configurable **`circuit_relay.max_hops`** (default **3** relay legs on path). The stack must **not** hardcode a protocol maximum — honor whatever limit ops/config sets (including &gt; 3). Loop detection and per-hop admission still apply.

**Parallel to punch:** Multi-hop covers **unpunchable** partitions; [H009](#h009--amp-coordinated-punch-acp) covers **punchable** direct paths. Neither blocks the other.

**Rationale:** L3 landed single-hop bridge; real meshes need transitive reachability. Broker model lets R1 own path + media economics and SLA.  
**Alternatives:** Retry only alternate single relays (rejected); consumer pays every hop (rejected); fixed compile-time hop max (rejected); wait for punch before multi-hop (rejected — different failure modes).  
**Spec:** [MULTI_HOP_CIRCUIT.md](MULTI_HOP_CIRCUIT.md). **Phase:** [L3.5](PHASES.md#l35--multi-hop-circuit-v2).

## H009 — Amp Coordinated Punch (ACP)

**Status:** Accepted (plan only — **not implemented**)  
**Date:** 2026-09-04  
**Decision:** Ship hole punching as **Amp Coordinated Punch**: an introducer that already has authenticated Sessions to both peers exchanges **observed Amp UDP endpoints** and a sync window; both sides simultaneous-dial; first authenticated PeerLink wins under **A026**, with **A027** parent-only teardown for the loser. Prefer seed / Reachable contact / current circuit R1 as introducer (v1). Optional **upgrade-from-circuit** promotes a direct PeerLink then demotes the tunnel.

**Not product paths:** WebRTC/ICE, app STUN, `call_hop_addrs`, libp2p Host DCUtR.

**Preference:** Inserted in [H002](#h002--publish-in-stack--punch--circuit--fail) between publish and circuit.

**Rationale:** After D10/A017 the underlay is Amp UDP; DCUtR-class behavior must be Amp-native. SoftMigrate must not grow a parallel NAT toolkit. Keepalive/`MaybeLearnPath` are not punch.  
**Alternatives:** App ICE gather (rejected — H004/H007); wait forever on UPnP/IPv6 only (rejected — many outbound-only homes); circuit-only forever (rejected — cost/latency); public STUN farm (rejected — second trust plane).  
**Spec:** [HOLE_PUNCH.md](HOLE_PUNCH.md). **Phase:** [L3.25](PHASES.md#l325--amp-coordinated-punch).

## H010 — Circuit StartBridge attempt budget (not exhaustive search)

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2026-09-21  
**Decision:** First-connect `EnsureViaCircuit` treats dialable relays as a **ranked queue with a spend limit**, not an exhaustive walk.

| Knob | Value | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|
| Envelope | **14s** (`kCircuitReachEnvelopeMs`) | Covers answerer seed park (~12s) + nest Establish |
| Per StartBridge | **≤4s**, nest slack held until last useful slice | `CircuitStartBridgeTimeoutMs` |
| Max StartBridge calls | **4** | Skips (`!endpoint`, undialable Preferred) do **not** count |
| Nest Establish | **≤8s**, clamped by remaining | After ack only |
| Order | Sticky last-good → Connected → rest | `OrderCircuitRelayAttempts` |
| Same-relay not-reg | **Repeat** until max bridges (no sticky required) | First dual-NAT often has empty sticky (dogfood bb3fbfab) |
| Sticky retry | **Once** on other fast-fail (incl. WaitAck `bridge timed out`) | Hop event-waits far leg |
| Hop ServeDial far-leg wait | **Event-driven** (PeerConnected / reserve / deadline ≤6s) | No Tick poll-resume; deadline is a timer event; **lost-wakeup recheck** after arm |
| Client seed park | **Event-driven** (PeerConnected on bootstrap PeerIds + deadline) | `EnsureBootstrapSeedParkedAsync` — no 250ms poll |
| Parallel StartBridge | **Forbidden** on first connect | Serial only (dogfood ADP path races) |
| Far-leg fail slack | **750ms** before dialer WaitAck | Hop must `fail_near` before dialer opaque `bridge timed out` (dogfood c44e34) |

Answerer remains punch-only + reserve (no reverse StartBridge on first pass). User Retry / TX-only escalate may open a **fresh** envelope later — not a longer first ring.

**Layering (connectivity owns readiness):** Park/reserve and ServeDial far-leg wait live in mesh / `CallMediaPlane` / `CircuitTunnelCoordinator`. Session workflow only speaks consumer needs: `ensure_circuit_ready` (kick) and `await_circuit_ready` (Accept gate) — no seed vocabulary. Sticky not-reg retry stays in `AmpCircuitHopReach` (L3 hop reach).

**ServeDial far-leg wait (event-driven):** When peer-id-only ServeDial has no Connected far leg, hop **arms a waiter** and returns. Resume on Amp `PeerConnectedListener` (PeerId), on live `op=reserve`, or on **deadline event** (`kCircuitServeDialFarLegWaitMs`, capped by tunnel deadline − **750ms** slack). After arm, **re-check** Connected (lost-wakeup between Count and arm). Do **not** poll-retry `BeginServe` from IoTick. Amp: `PeerLinkManager::AddPeerConnectedListener` (multi-listener). Any ServeDial tunnel deadline must `fail_near` (ack) before TearDown — never leave dialer WaitAck to invent `bridge timed out`.

**Client seed park (event-driven):** `EnsureBootstrapSeedParkedAsync` finishes on PeerConnected for a bootstrap/directory PeerId (or deadline). No 250ms poll. Dialer **same-relay** not-reg retries immediately (hop already event-waits); sticky not required. On that retry, dialer re-announces R1 (`OnRelayChosen` / `call_circuit_r1`) so answerer `PreferLateReserve` can re-park (B27).

**Reserve key / re-park (B27):** `op=reserve` is keyed by the protocol-handler PeerId (not a possibly-empty mid-handshake `link.RemotePeerId()`). Empty remote refuses reserve. ServeDial logs `reservation_hit` / `connected_for_target`. Answerer arms a PeerConnected listener on the shared rendezvous surface and re-`StartReserve` when a surface peer reconnects after path change (stale reserve dies with the old ADP link).

**Early circuit-ready (Ringing + Accept gate):** Offerer kicks ready on `StartCall`; answerer on inbound invite; `AcceptInvite` may **await** ready (up to 12s) before `CallAccept`. Hop event wait is the primary race absorber (needs Brief rebuild); Accept await is a thin product backstop.

**Seed park gate:** Before private-Preferred `EnsureAssociation` and again before circuit/punch Ensure, await up to **12s** for bootstrap/directory seeds. Prefer **all** seed PeerIds Connected before finishing early (dialer may StartBridge hop2 while answerer only parked hop1 — dogfood ae4900eb); deadline still accepts ≥1 Connected. A timed-out pre-assoc park must **not** be treated as success (dogfood 88e16f5c). After a successful park, **skip** private-Preferred `EnsureAssociation` (dogfood 39412f). **Answerer** always skips private Preferred when circuit reach is wired. Warm/reserve: connect cold seeds serially without stopping at the first already-Connected; **reserve all** Connected seeds so dialer StartBridge can land on hop2.

**Peer-id-only ServeDial:** Never fall through to dial-book Preferred. Private Preferred hangs hop `EnsureAssociation` until dialer WaitAck `circuit-relay bridge timed out` (dogfood dual-NAT / Windows dialer). Open call-media via `FindLinkByPeerId` + `OpenChannelOnLink` on the live link. Event-wait for Connected far leg; fail `not registered` on deadline so H010 sticky retry can advance.

**Single policy home:** [`CircuitServeDialPolicy.h`](../../src/domain/mesh/l4/circuit/CircuitServeDialPolicy.h) — shared by hop `BeginServe` / `NormalizeAmpCircuitTarget` and CallMediaBridge seed-park skip (same dual-NAT rule, one header).

CallMediaBridge `kCircuitEnsureBudgetMs` tracks the envelope (~16s with settle slack), not N×20s.

**Rationale:** Directory + DHT + seeds can yield many dialable PeerIds; full WaitAck per candidate blows the connecting window even when ranking is correct. Warm/reserve + short tries beat more candidates.

**Alternatives:** Fixed 20s×N (rejected — dogfood bridge timeout stack); parallel multi-bridge (rejected — UDP path AV); truncate candidate list only without remaining clamp (rejected — still burns on slow misses).

**Code:** `CircuitHopAttemptBudget.h`, `AmpCircuitHopReach::EnsureViaCircuitAsync`.

## H011 — Circuit R1 rendezvous (dialer-authoritative)

**Status:** Accepted — **L3.1a–d landed** (shared surface, sticky park, `call_circuit_r1`, hard-w5 STACK)  
**Date:** 2026-09-21  
**Decision:** Immediate circuit relay (**R1**) for nested call-media is a **dialer-authoritative rendezvous**, not bilateral hop consensus.

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Dialer** | Sole selector of R1 (H010 ranked queue + budget) |
| **Answerer** | Parks/reserves a **shared rendezvous surface** covering the dialer’s likely top-K; punch-only on first pass (no reverse StartBridge) |
| **Optional confirm** | After StartBridge ack, dialer may announce **one** `circuit_r1` PeerId so answerer can late-reserve ([H007](#h007--no-app-layer-hop-candidate-exchange-as-product-path) carve-out) |

**Shared surface:** Both sides derive the same ordered PeerId list from mesh eligibility (`BuildCircuitHopList` / dialability filter). Answerer must not use a seeds-only subset that the dialer can walk past. Coverage: all Connected members of the surface, plus enough members to cover **K = `kCircuitMaxStartBridgeAttempts`**.

**Does not change:** H010 spend limits; H008 multi-hop path behind R1; V023 SoftMigrate `media_relay` B pick; session ports (`ensure_circuit_ready` / `await_circuit_ready` stay hop-PeerId-free).

**Rationale:** Independent selection caused dual-NAT not-reg / bridge-timeout races (dialer hop2 vs answerer park hop1). Reserve-all and sticky retry are mitigations; ownership of “final R1” was undefined. Dialer-as-chooser matches H008/N024 “consumer picks one immediate relay.”  
**Alternatives:** Bilateral vote / ICE-style pairs (rejected — H007, complexity); answerer picks and dialer follows (rejected — ServeDial is dialer-driven StartBridge); parallel StartBridge (rejected — H010); exhaustive search (rejected — H010); rely forever on reserve-all luck (rejected — surface asymmetry remains).  
**Spec:** [CIRCUIT_R1_RENDEZVOUS.md](CIRCUIT_R1_RENDEZVOUS.md). **Phase:** [L3.1](PHASES.md#l31--circuit-r1-rendezvous).

## H012 — Punch via call signaling when no Amp introducer

**Date:** 2026-09-23  
**Status:** Accepted — **implemented** (L3.25d / B29 client path)  
**Decision:** When Amp Coordinated Punch ([H009](#h009--amp-coordinated-punch-acp)) cannot run because **no introducer Session** exists to both peers (typical: circuit `endpoint not registered` on all seeds — B27), allow a **narrow carve-out of [H007](#h007--no-app-layer-hop-candidate-exchange-as-product-path)**: exchange **ACP punch candidates + sync window** over existing **call-control / relay inbox** signaling, then both sides simultaneous-dial under A026.

| Allowed | Forbidden |
|---------|-----------|
| Observed Amp UDP endpoints already in addr book / dial-back / UPnP (same as H009 collect) | Reintroducing `call_hop_addrs` as SoftMigrate hop shopping |
| Short punch epoch (nonce / window) mirrored from H009 | App STUN / WebRTC ICE (H004) |
| Trigger only after Amp introducer path failed or is unavailable | Using signaling punch as the **primary** path when seeds can introduce |

**Wire:** `call_punch_offer` / `call_punch_answer` (CallControlCodec) carrying candidate multiaddrs + sync window; `AmpPunchCoordinator::TrySignalingPunchBurstAsync` runs BurstDial without an Amp Session to I. Cold-punch exhaust in `CallMediaPlane` → `CallSessionManager::RequestSignalingPunch`.

**Rationale:** Cross-net dogfood (PR #214 B29): ICMP to the right IPv6 answered but punch never burst because introducer needed circuit registration. Signaling already delivers Invite/Accept; it can stand in for I when Amp I is down without inventing a second reachability stack.

**Alternatives:** Wait for B27 relay fix only (rejected — leaves punch dead until seeds work); public STUN farm (rejected — H004); circuit-only forever (rejected — cost/latency).

**Spec:** [HOLE_PUNCH.md](HOLE_PUNCH.md#signaling-introducer-fallback-h012). **Phase:** [L3.25d](PHASES.md#l325--amp-coordinated-punch).
